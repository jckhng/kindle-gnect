# Installing On Kindle

## Prerequisites

This package targets jailbroken Kindle devices that can run KUAL extensions.

You need:

- A jailbroken Kindle.
- KUAL installed.
- MRPI installed if your jailbreak/KUAL setup uses MRPI for package installs.
- USB access to copy the extension package.

Kindle jailbreak compatibility depends on model and firmware. Follow the
current guide for your exact device.

## Install

Unzip `release/exact-four-in-a-row-extension.zip` at the Kindle USB-storage root.

Expected paths:

```text
/mnt/us/extensions/exact-four-in-a-row
/mnt/us/documents/shortcut_exactfourinarow.sh
```

Fix execute bits over SSH if needed:

```sh
chmod 755 /mnt/us/extensions/exact-four-in-a-row/*.sh
chmod 755 /mnt/us/extensions/exact-four-in-a-row/bin/armhf/exact-four-in-a-row
chmod 755 /mnt/us/documents/shortcut_exactfourinarow.sh
```

Launch from KUAL:

```text
KUAL -> Exact Four in a Row -> Launch
```

The document shortcut is optional. KUAL is the reliable launch path; a stock
Kindle home screen normally will not execute `.sh` files unless another script
launcher/file association is installed.

Logs:

```sh
tail -n 120 /mnt/us/exact-four-in-a-row.log
tail -n 120 /mnt/us/exact-four-in-a-row-shortcut.log
```
